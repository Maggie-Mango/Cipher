<!--Cupcake Shop
Create a new website for a cupcake shop. Your site should have images, text and links. Be creative!
Pick three HTML elements and give them a class called flashy, and create a CSS rule to make them red and italic.
Create a class called best and add it to the most popular cupcake featured on your site. Apply a style of your choice to make it stand out.-->
